Pegylated-interferon alpha 2a or 2b/Ribavirin	Antivirals	IFNL3 Unfavorable response	Decreased likelihood of sustained virologic response (SVR) to PEG-IFN-alpha and ribavirin therapy	ATYPICAL	"An unfavorable response genotype corresponds to an approximately 30% chance for SVR after 48 weeks of treatment, or approximately 60% chance for SVR if combined with a protease inhibitor. Consider implications before initiating PEG-IFN alpha and RBV containing regimens."	IFNL3 is a cytokine with an important role in the antiviral host defense. IFNL3 genetic variation has been associated with treatment induced clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) following pegylated interferon-alpha (PEG-IFN-alpha) and ribavirin (RBV) therapy.
