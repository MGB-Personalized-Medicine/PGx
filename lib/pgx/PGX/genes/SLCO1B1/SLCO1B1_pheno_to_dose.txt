Simvastatin	Cholesterol reduction	SLCO1B1 Decreased function	Decrease dosage of simvastatin or use alternative drug	ATYPICAL	"This result indicates that the patient carries one normal function allele and one decreased function allele of SLCO1B1, predicting decreased SLCO1B1 function. Patients with this genotype may need a lower starting dose of simvastatin or an alternate statin agent, as they are at increased risk of simvastatin-associated myopathy."	"SLCO1B1 encodes a transporter protein that enables the uptake of statins into the liver. Individuals with decreased or poor SLCO1B1 function may be at increased risk for developing simvastatin-associated myopathy.

Simvastatin	Cholesterol reduction	SLCO1B1 Poor function	Decrease dosage of simvastatin or use alternative drug	ATYPICAL	"This result indicates that the patient carries two decreased function alleles of SLCO1B1, predicting poor SLCO1B1 function. Patients with this genotype may require a lower starting dose of simvastatin or an alternate statin agent, as they are at high risk of simvastatin-associated myopathy. If simvastatin is prescribed, creatine kinase levels may need to be monitored routinely."	"SLCO1B1 encodes a transporter protein that enables the uptake of statins into the liver.
