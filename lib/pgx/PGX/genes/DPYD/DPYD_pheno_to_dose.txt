5-Fluorouracil/Capecitabine	"Fluoropyrimidines, antineoplastic"	DPYD Intermediate metabolizer - Activity Score 1	Decrease dosage of fluoropyrimidines	ATYPICAL	"This result indicates that the patient carries two decreased function alleles or one normal function and one non- functional allele of DPYD, resulting in decreased DPD activity (AS=1). Patients with this genotype typically require decreased doses of fluoropyrimidines, and are at increased risk of toxicity."	"Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD, encoded by the DPYD gene) metabolizes fluoropyrimidines, commonly used chemotherapeutic agents. Individuals with reduced DPYD enzyme activity are at risk of severe or even fatal toxicity from fluoropyrimidines.

5-Fluorouracil/Capecitabine	"Fluoropyrimidines, antineoplastic"	DPYD Poor metabolizer - Activity Score 0	Use alternative drug	ATYPICAL	"This result indicates that the patient carries two non-functional copies of DPYD, resulting in absent DPD activity (AS=0). Patients with this genotype are at high risk of fluoropyrimidine toxicity, and an alternative drug should be selected."

5-Fluorouracil/Capecitabine	"Fluoropyrimidines, antineoplastic"	DPYD Poor metabolizer - Activity Score 0.5	Use alternative drug	ATYPICAL	"This result indicates that the patient carries one decreased function and one non-functional allele of DPYD, resulting in very decreased DPD activity (AS=0.5). Patients with this genotype are at high risk of fluoropyrimidine toxicity, and an alternative drug should be selected. In some cases, a greatly decreased dosage of fluoropyrimidines might be considered."
