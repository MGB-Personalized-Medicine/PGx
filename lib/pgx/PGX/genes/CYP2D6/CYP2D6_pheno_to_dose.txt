Paroxetine	Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)	CYP2D6 Intermediate Metabolizer  - Activity score 0.25 to 1	Standard dosage of paroxetine	STANDARD	"This result indicates that the patient carries one decreased and one no function allele or two decreased function alleles or one no function allele and one normal function allele, predicting intermediate metabolizer status for CYP2D6 substrates. Use label recommended dosage."	"Paroxetine is metabolized by CYP2D6 to less active metabolites.  CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizers may have low to undetectable paroxetine plasma concentrations as compared to CYP2D6 normal metabolizers, increasing the risk of treatment failure, while CYP2D6 poor metabolizers may have higher paroxetine exposure and be at increased risk of side effects from paroxetine.

Fluvoxamine	Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)	CYP2D6 Ultrarapid Metabolizer - Activity score >2.25	No recommendation for fluvoxamine	STANDARD	"This result indicates that the patient carries more than two copies of functional alleles of CYP2D6, predicting ultrarapid metabolizer status for CYP2D6 substrates. Use label recommended dosage, as there is not currently sufficient evidence to recommend alternative dosing of fluvoxamine."	Fluvoxamine is metabolized by CYP2D6 to less active metabolites.
