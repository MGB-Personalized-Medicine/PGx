Azathioprine/ Mercaptopurine/ Thioguanine	"Thiopurines, immunosuppressants"	NUDT15 Intermediate metabolizer	Decrease dosage of thiopurines	ATYPICAL	"This result indicates that the patient carries one normal function and one no function allele of NUDT15. Patients with this genotype typically require decreased doses of thiopurines. They may be at increased risk of developing leukopenia, neutropenia or myelosuppression with standard doses."	"Autoimmune diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are often treated with thiopurine therapy. Leukopenia, neutropenia and myelosuppression are possible adverse effects. While other genetic and clinical factors may also influence a patient's risk for these adverse effects, variants in TPMT and NUDT15 have been found that increase a patient's risk.

Azathioprine/ Mercaptopurine/ Thioguanine	"Thiopurines, immunosuppressants"	NUDT15 Poor metabolizer	Greatly decrease dosage of thiopurines or consider alternative drug	ATYPICAL	"This result indicates that the patient carries two no function copies of NUDT15. Patients with this genotype typically require greatly decreased doses of thiopurines or should consider alternative drugs, as they are at greatly increased risk of leukopenia, neutropenia or myelosuppression with standard doses."
