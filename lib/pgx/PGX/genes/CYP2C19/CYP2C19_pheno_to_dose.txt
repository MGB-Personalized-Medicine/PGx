Amitriptyline/ Clomipramine/Doxepin/Imipramine/Trimipramine	Tertiary amine tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)	CYP2C19 Rapid metabolizer	Consider use of alternative drug	ATYPICAL	"This result indicates that the patient carries one copy of an increased function allele and one copy of a normal function allele of CYP2C19, predicting rapid metabolizer status for CYP2C19 substrates. Consider selecting an alternative drug not metabolized by CYP2C19, or if a tertiary amine tricyclic is warranted, utilize therapeutic drug monitoring."	"The CPIC guidelines for TCAs include the genes CYP2C19 and CYP2D6. Dosing recommendations only apply to higher initial doses of TCAs for treatment of conditions such as depression. (Dosing recommendations for neuropathic pain treatment with lower doses can be found in the text of Hicks 2017 PMID: 27997040.) CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 poor or (ultra)rapid metabolizers may have an increased risk of treatment failure or side effects. Table 3 of Hicks 2017 PMID: 27997040 provides recommendations for TCAs based on CYP2C19 diplotypes in the absence of CYP2D6 diplotype knowledge. Tricyclic antidepressants have comparable pharmacokinetic properties, so it may be reasonable to apply the CPIC guideline for amitriptyline and CYP2C19, CYP2D6 to other tertiary amine tricyclics including clomipramine, doxepin, imipramine, and trimipramine.
